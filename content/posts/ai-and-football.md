FIFA has been using video technology to referee matches in the World Cup since 2018, and AI is taking a significant role in officiating among all top sports leagues. In 2022, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to play an even bigger role when it comes to refereeing the FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
The use of AI will be far more advanced than it was in 2018. This time around, AI will be integrated into different parts of the game, such as analyzing player movements, tracking fouls and managing video replays. Additionally, AI will monitor player fatigue levels, ensuring that only fit players can play and that those who show signs of exhaustion are immediately taken off the field for evaluation.
The introduction of AI technology into the game promises to reduce mistakes often seen in officiating football games today. Using facial recognition software, cameras will be able to detect if a player is illegally entering an opponent's penalty area or stretching too far ahead of their team-mates during a set-play situation. Objectivity will come from an accurate analysis by AI algorithms which can watch videos frame by frame and identify any questionable plays which were missed by human referees on the ground. This can also include mistakes regarding yellow or red cards decisions without relying on discretional decision making from referees with inherently human flaws such as fatigue or personal biases clouding their judgement of plays.
Overall, football fans seen improvements in terms of fan experience at the 2022 FIFA World Cup while being presented by FIFA that they are witnessing fair judging and officiating without controversial calls favoring either sides which have been historically known issues amongst professional sports leagues globally until now.
